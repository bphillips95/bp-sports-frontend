#  BP SPORTS

BP SPORTS is a baseball blogging website that allows users to write baseball articles.

Users have the ability to sign up as writers and write, edit and delete articles. Users who do not sign up, may still read articles. Users can also buy merchandise and see a live MLB scoreboard.

The backend can be found at https://github.com/bphillips95/bp-sports-backend

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites, just got to https://bp-sports.netlify.com/ and you can run the app.

## Technologies Used 

* JavaScript
* ReactJS
* Redux
* Ruby
* Rails
* React-Router
* React Quill
* JWT
* BCrypt
* Semantic UI React
* Bootstrap
* ESPN API
* React Google Analytics
* PostgresSQL

This app is built with ReactJS for the front-end, and Ruby on Rails back-end. It utilizes Redux to store information in a central state. Styling is either Semantic-UI-React, Bootstrap, or bare CSS. The app uses React Google Analytics to track article views, and time spent on each article. React-Router is used for routing. React Quill Text Editor is used for writing and editing the articles. I learned Redux while creating the app, so I created seperate files for each reducer, for simplicity's sake.
